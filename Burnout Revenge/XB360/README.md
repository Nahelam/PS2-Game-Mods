# Burnout Revenge XB360 Mods (Xenia)

Mods I made for the Xbox 360 version of **Burnout Revenge**.

Use the **TU0** file if you're using the base version of the game (most common).\
If you installed the game update use the **TU1** file instead.

## Enabling/Disabling patches

To enable or disable a patch, change its `is_enabled` value to `true` or `false`.
