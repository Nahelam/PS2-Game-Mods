# Burnout 3: Takedown PS2 Demo Mods (PCSX2)

Mods I made for the PlayStation 2 demo versions of **Burnout 3: Takedown**.

## Mod List
- Disable "demo" mode (brings back replays, 3 laps races, and probably more)
- Green text track selection menu (to avoid the broken Crash Nav track selection menu)
- 480p video mode
- Manual transmission (L2 downshift, R2 upshift)
- Disable time and/or lap limit(s) in Road Rage mode
- Start Eliminator mode instead of Single Race mode (hold L2 while selecting car)
