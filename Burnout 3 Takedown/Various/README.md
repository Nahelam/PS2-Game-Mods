- "Rivals number in road rage options" is also included in "Select rivals cars in garage".
- **DO NOT** use "Enable lap timer in race mode" and "Enable lap timer in road rage mode" together.
- Disable the takedown camera if you don't want the game to bring you back car controls while using the AI controlled patch
